#summary What happens with Flash ByteArrays

= What is it? =

The flash/flex bytearray is an object that allows you to deal with binary data. [http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/2/langref/flash/utils/ByteArray.html documentation]

= How SabreAMF handles it =

SabreAMF has an `SabreAMF_ByteArray` class. It is actually extremely simple, because strings in PHP5 are treated as binary data.. All it really does is wrap a string in an object. 

= Example, sending back a jpeg =

This example assumes that mypicture.jpg exists in the current folder. This method belongs in most cases in a service object.

{{{
<?php

  function getPicture() {

     $data = file_get_contents('mypicture.jpg');
     $byteArray = new SabreAMF_ByteArray($data);

     return $byteArray;

  }

?>
}}}
